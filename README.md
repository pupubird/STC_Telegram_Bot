## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

As Sunway Tech Club uses Telegram as it's main communication channel, it went harder and harder to manage all the groups and channels, hence, a bot that helps to manage and even generate quick video meeting link is becoming more important.

Why not using Slack? Well, because building a telegram bot sounds cooler 😎.

## 💭 How it works <a name = "working"></a>

Bots are special Telegram accounts designed to handle messages automatically. Users can interact with bots by sending them command messages in private or group chats. These accounts serve as an interface for code running somewhere on your server.

This bot uses [Telegraf](https://telegraf.js.org/#/) as a wrapper to the telegram core API to ease out and smoothen the development process.

## 🎈 Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
